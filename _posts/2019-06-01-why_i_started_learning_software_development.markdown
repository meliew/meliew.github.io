I honestly never thought I’d learn how to code. I always viewed it as something for a certain group - those who were talented in engineering or electronics, and also people who were known for being techies. You know the type - they’ve got the latest and greatest gadgets, and they know how to use a new piece of tech well before the general population has even heard of it. That was never me. Quite the contrary in fact…(as I write this, I’ve got my iPhone 5 sitting next to me, and yes the X has been out for quite some time). 

I’ve always been a creative person and have spent a lot of time working on things like: writing, photography, knitting, acting, screenwriting, jewelry design (you get the picture). I am also a serial entrepreneur, and generally created startups out of every creative skill I learned. But, 2018 was not kind to my latest venture. I was in the midst of a successful copywriting business, when suddenly it all came to a screeching halt. I’m still not entirely sure why, but the clients stopped showing up, the work ended, and I was left wondering what in the world I was supposed to do. One thing was clear - writing was on the wall (pardon the pun)...it was time to move into a different field. It wasn’t the first time I’d had to make a pivot in my career. I’ve been a personal trainer, event coordinator, jewelry designer/business owner, newborn photographer, and now writer. So, yeah, changing course was a given. However, this was the first time I considered something outside my typical creative choices. And, yes, I have since learned that coding can be creative too! 

As I was looking for various fields that might be a good fit for me, my brother, a senior software engineer, again suggested that I try coding. I had heard from him many a time about how great it was, and what kind of career I could build, but my response was usually, “thanks, but no thanks.” However, this time was a little bit different. See, I had just watched my sister transform her life from a hair stylist to web developer in the space of one year. She went on to land a job that she really loves. It then dawned on me...if I could actually learn to code I could get away from the struggle cycle that I felt I went around and around on. I could get away from dealing with the subjectivity that comes with a creative endeavor, and I could have the freedom that having a great job can bring. 

So, I dove into a bootcamp...It didn’t go well. 

Looking back, I realize that I should have done my homework first, but I’m the kind of person that will sometimes dive into the pool before asking how deep it is. I was completely lost because I hadn’t done any sort of pre-work and there weren’t a lot of resources for getting help. My brother was willing to help me, but I felt like I had started something way out of my league and I left the bootcamp. 

Still encouraged to learn, I found an online class and started taking baby steps towards coding. That’s when I found Flatiron School. Initially, I thought I’d join the self-paced program, but realized that the community, sessions with the cohort lead, and pair programming would be very valuable resources for me. I also liked that there was pre-work involved and that I was able to get the necessary basics down before diving into the actual bootcamp. Even though I’m only a few weeks into the bootcamp, I feel confident telling people that I’m learning to code. I’m also confident that while this is not a particularly easy path for me, it is one that I can continue on and that I will succeed.
